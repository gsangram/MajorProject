<h2> Hyderabad is the pearl city of india.
    
    <p id="pid01" style="color:red"> One summer day in 1957, we headed to the courthouse for a marriage license. 
                My husband-to-be, Steve, asked the clerk for a fishing license. She advised him a fishing 
                license cost $1.50 and a marriage license cost $2.50. With some thought and a smile, he chose 
                the marriage license, and so our life together, later filled with two children, began. </p>
